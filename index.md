I am a software entrepreneur based in the Bay Area.

- Co-founded [Volition](https://www.volition.co), a small but well-funded team that builds AI-powered software.
- Previously, co-founded [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com). If you took a STEM class at a major university in the last 5-10 years, you’ve likely used it.
- Co-developed [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/llm-bootcamp/), a set of courses on building AI-powered software.
- Did my PhD at UC Berkeley, working with [Trevor Darrell](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/darrell.html) on computer vision.
- Went to University of Washington for undegrad.
- Originally from Russia, moved to Seattle when I was 11.

## Volition

The co-founders of Gradescope re-united to start [Volition](https://volition.co), a product studio.
We are currently working on the [best way to build software with AI agents](https://www.superconductor.dev).

## Recent Vibe Projects

Claude Code with Opus 4.5 is a [watershed moment](https://x.com/sergeykarayev/status/2007899893483045321) for software development, making the first 80% of an app take minutes instead of days. I'm making my way through a backlog of little software ideas with it.

## Gradescope

I co-founded [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com), an AI-assisted tool for grading all kinds of exams and assignments.
Gradescope was acquired as a standalone product by [Turnitin](https://turnitin.com), a leading ed tech provider, where I worked as Head of AI.

## PhD at UC Berkeley

I finished a PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, working on computer vision with [Trevor Darrell][td], teaching with [Pieter Abbeel][pa], and interning at Adobe Creative Technologies Lab and Artsy.

### Recognizing Image Style

During a summer research internship at Adobe Creative Technologies Lab, I gathered datasets of photo and painting style, and used CNNs to classify different visual styles.

### Caffe Deep Learning Framework

The deep learning paradigm shift was enabled by open source software, including Caffe from our Berkeley research lab.
The Caffe team was [honored by the Everingham Prize](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/news/2017/10/caffe-team-wins-everingham-prize-iccv-2017) in 2017.

### Anytime Visual Recognition

Features have different costs and different classes benefit from different features.
A multi-class recognition system should dynamically select them to maximize performance under a cost budget.
This line of work constitutes my [PhD Thesis](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-207.pdf).

### Depth-informed Object Detection

Using the Microsoft Kinect, we gather a large dataset of indoor crowded scenes.
We investigate ways to unify state-of-the-art object detection systems and improve them with depth information.

### Probabilistic Local Image Features

Our method for additively decomposing local image patches shows best performance on a novel transparent object recognition dataset.
We extend the model to multiple layers and apply it to general object classification.

## BS at University of Washington

I was fortunate to work first with [Luis Ceze](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/) and then [Steve Seitz](https://www.smseitz.com) on undergraduate research at UW Seattle.
In 2019, I was honored by the [UW Engineering Early Career Award](https://www.engr.washington.edu/alumni/diamond/2019honorees#early).
