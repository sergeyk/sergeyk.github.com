I"t<p>(Joint work with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~adarob/">Adam Roberts</a> and <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pimentel/">Harold Pimentel</a>.)</p>

<p>We have developed a cloud-based mobile web application to match users who request similar trips and would like to share a cab.
The application is hosted on Amazonâ€™s EC2 service and combines several open-source frameworks (Django, PostgresQL, Redis, Node.js) with social networking (Facebook), mapping, and location-awareness (Google) APIs.
The modularity of our design allows the service to easily scale in the cloud as the user base grows.</p>

(The application is now offline, sorry.)</p>
