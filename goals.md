# Goals

I’d like to improve the world a bit, in three ways:

- Flourish as a person
- Help my family and friends flourish.
- Create businesses that help people flourish.

*Flourish*: to grow in a healthy way. I like that. If things aren't growing, they’re dying. On the other hand, growth should not come at the expense of health or quality.

## **Flourish as a person**

I am a part of the world, so if I am more alive, the world is a little bit more alive in turn. And if I’m not doing well, I won’t be effective at any other goals for very long.

What this means to me:

- Eat healthy and exercise.
- Work with talented people I like.
- Feel pride in the work that we do.
- Make memories with family and friends.
- Share my thoughts and learn from others.

The North Star question for this goal is, “How much of last week did I feel like an integral part of the world’s flow?”

- Was I filled with energy?
- Was I in flow state a large part of the day?
- Was I present and positive in my interactions with others?

## **Help my family and friends flourish**

This is the corner of the world that I have the most impact on. If my toddler had a choice, I’m sure that he would choose spending time with me over receiving a larger inheritance, and therefore I choose that too.

What this means to me:

- Be a present and wise father to my kids.
- Build a dream life with my beautiful [wife](https://nicolettekarayev.com/about/).
- Spend quality time with my parents and other relatives.
- Build a community of friends and support them in times of need.

The North Star question for this goal is, “If my funeral were to be held next week, who’d be there and what would they say?”

## **Create things that help people flourish**

I am a generalist entrepreneur at heart. I am not a scientist, merchant, soldier, politician, or anything else I can think of to the same degree. “Teacher” would be the second best-fitting role for me.

These are the things an entrepreneur does:

- Have an open mind to notice *problems*: ways in which the world could be better.
- Use creativity, knowledge, and communication to develop *solutions* to problems worth solving.
- Use determination and irrationality to turn these solutions into self-sustaining *businesses*.

The North Star question for this goal is, “How much wealth am I creating for the world?”
