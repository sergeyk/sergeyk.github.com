<div class='post_body'><p>After our 100 mile ride to Portland (average speed 12 MPH), we commenced not doing much at all. On Saturday we went to Powell&#39;s world of books, where I acquired Sometimes a Great Notion, which I had been meaning to read for a while. We also tasted of the great Apizza School&#39;s, and played free pool while listening to free jukebox tunes (fiery furnaces).</p> <p>Saturday night we stayed with a stranger found via <a href="http://warmshowers.com">warmshowers.com</a>. He turned out to be pretty cool and we capped the night off at a folk music house show somewhere in the bluffs of Portland. I have to figure out how to move to Portland, its pretty sweet.</p> <p>Then on the 4th of July Sam and I took a bus to Cannon Beach where we witnessed a parade and acquired an impressive quantity of candy. Pam and Aaron drove in a little later and we walked around on the beach and had sausages with grilled onions. I also had some time to hang out in a coffee shop--always a good time!<br /> </p> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
