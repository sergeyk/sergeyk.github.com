	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since my last post, I have taken only 2 pictures, which I here present. The reason for the dearth is that I only take pictures of good things, and few good things happened. Yesterday, after Netherlands whoopered Uruguay, I lay down on a beach. The piercing wind was cold but the sun and sand were hot and I was pleased. But after we got on our bikes again, nothing went right. Strong headwinds, long hills, closed shops, and the awfulness of Lincoln City defeated us.Â  Oh, and I also got a flat. Actually, two.</p> <p>Today, we rode 60 miles of reportedly some of the most beautiful stretches of coast in Oregon, which today happened to be shrouded in a cold gray mist. The ride was supposed to be moderately easy, but because instead of the tailwinds the book assumes we keep riding into headwind, today exceptionally ferocious, we didn&#39;t reach camp until 930. </p> <p>But some good things happened: we did see some great views, and we ate delicious sandwiches for lunch in Newport. The photos quite poorly document these two facts. </p> <p>Tomorrow should be an easy 20 miles to Winchester Bay, and then hanging out with Mallory in the sand dunes. Good night.</p> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

Why the hell wouldn't you get the Turkey Gobler? It looks delicious. Otherwise, good post. Keep up the good work.
